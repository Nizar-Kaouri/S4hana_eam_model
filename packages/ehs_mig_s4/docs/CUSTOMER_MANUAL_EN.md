# ModuPorter Environment Health and Safety — native draft 0.3.0

This replaces the 0.1.0 staging architecture. Native SAP table → Basic → Composite → Consumption is supplied for documented structures. Target comparison views read native tables. No customer staging tables or write loaders are included.

## Research update

6 native drafts; 17 pending structures. Public documents establish field usage, not customer DDIC flags or SAP activation.

| Structure | Status | Native table | Scope and remaining work |
|---|---|---|---|
| EHSLocation | PENDING | EHFNDD_LOC_ROOT; EHFNDD_LOC_REV | Location/revision tables documented through CDS sources, but plant/type/validity native field mapping and revision selection remain unresolved. A root identity projection would not complete location coverage. |
| EHSLocHierarchy | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| ChemicalProp | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| PropertyUnit | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| Specification | NATIVE_DRAFT | ESTRH | Classic specification model. Preserve all change states; no unverified latest-record rule. |
| SpecIdentifier | NATIVE_DRAFT | ESTRI | Native short identifier only; long-text interfaces and effective parent change-state relations remain pending. |
| SpecProperty | PENDING | ESTVH; ESTVA; classification value relations unresolved | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| Phrase | NATIVE_DRAFT | ESTPH | Phrase header only. ESTPP multilingual text and graphics are pending; no invented Language key on the header. |
| PhraseSet | NATIVE_DRAFT | ESTPJ | Phrase-set assignment records; not the complete phrase-set definition. Preserve native record and change-state keys. |
| Incident | NATIVE_DRAFT | EHHSSD_INC_ROOT | Modern EHSM incident root only. Basic-info child cardinality, title, location and time-zone calculations remain pending. Preserve root UUID; no guessed join to multiply root rows. |
| IncidentPerson | PENDING | EHHSSD_INC_PINV; EHHSSD_INC_PROLE | Person identity/name fields are resolved from HCM/business partners/users; roles come from a separate node. Native reference keys, role cardinality and person resolution remain pending. |
| IncidentAction | NATIVE_DRAFT | EHHSSD_IAC_ROOT | Separate EHSM action business-object root, not an incident child with a guessed PARENT_KEY. Action-to-incident/root-cause reference resolution and incident-only population remain pending. Broad action snapshot includes other reference origins. Title and resolved person names are extractor-derived and excluded. |
| RiskAssessment | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| RiskHazard | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| RiskControl | PENDING | Transient EHSM risk-control extractor | Extractor origin fields are derived/transient rather than a documented physical one-table schema. Native business-object node mapping remains unresolved. |
| DataClassifier | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| DataCollection | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| Measurement | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| ComplianceReq | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| ComplianceScen | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| ComplianceLink | PENDING | Not yet established | Native field definitions, complete DDIC keys and/or application model unresolved; no staging fallback or executable view supplied. |
| DangerousGoods | PENDING | EST0D | Classic classification records and administration fields documented; material dangerous-goods master mapping, regulation references and complete classification payload remain unresolved. |
| DGTransport | PENDING | EST0F | Classic import-format documentation supports regulation/classification payload, but SUBIDREF is an import shorthand rather than established physical column. Complete reference keys and transport-mode mapping remain pending. |

## Installation and verification

1. Confirm the installed application and release. EWM is not LE-WM; classic EHS specifications are not modern EHSM incidents. Direct table extraction assumes on-premise/private-cloud or compatible decentralized ABAP systems. Public Cloud developer restrictions are not resolved by these templates.
2. Verify each native table, every field and its complete DDIC keys through SE11/ADT. The shipped key declarations are draft candidates, not SAP-tested metadata. Use the read-only full-row helper to export DDIC fields; run tools/migration_ddic.py against the actual .fields.csv and the structure mapping. Do not fabricate a schema export.
3. Import SOURCE and TARGET into the appropriate systems and follow ACTIVATION_ORDER.txt. Native tables must already exist. Source uses classic CDS; target uses view entities. Exact minimum application/ABAP releases remain pending. No SAP activation/runtime has been performed.
4. Verify permitted and restricted users and current-client behavior. No DCL is supplied. The helper checks S_TABU_NAM display authorization; this does not authorize every CDS extraction channel.
5. Export native consumption data with CDS aliases into customer/exports. Record system, client, export time and approved business population outside the CDS. Origin metadata is no longer an invented table key. The helper exports raw TABLE-FIELD columns, not consumption aliases or consumption filters.
6. Fill customer/selection with approved complete native keys. Empty selections yield zero rows. Run `python tools/migration_run.py --project customer/customer-cohort-project.json --out prepared`. The selection pipeline is not a business-state, dependency-closure or cutover calculation. Approve those separately.
7. Export the same target population using native comparison views. Map changed business identifiers and regenerated UUIDs before comparing; retain an audit ledger. Native UUID equality across systems is not assumed. Use migration_prepare.py compare with the relevant mapping and view. Count views are broad candidate counts; apply the same population before using totals.
8. Preserve EHS RECN/ACTN history and validity/deletion flags; no latest-record filter is asserted. Verify TM category constants and lifecycle scope. General case attributes include multiple case types. Payload absent from a native draft is pending, not successfully migrated.
9. Record activation, key uniqueness, authorization, extraction completeness, selection and source/target comparison in customer/TEST_RESULTS.csv. Real SAP evidence is required before acceptance.

Extraction views are read-only. No posting adapter or target business-object creation is supplied.


See customer/native-coverage.json for remaining payload and PROVENANCE.md for evidence. No posting adapters.
