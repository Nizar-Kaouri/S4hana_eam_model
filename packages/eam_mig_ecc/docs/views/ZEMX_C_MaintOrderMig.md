## Purpose

Open maintenance orders (not technically completed, not closed, not deleted).

## Keys

- `MaintenanceOrder`

## Associations defined here

- none

## Access control

No DCL by design: Migration view on ECC: it must return every record of the object. Access is controlled by the user / RFC user of the load program and the extraction channel (S_TABU_NAM), not by CDS access control (decision XGEN-D01; CDS access control also needs a newer release than the 7.40 SP08 baseline).

## Example use case

The load program creates one order per row.

## Open verification items

none
