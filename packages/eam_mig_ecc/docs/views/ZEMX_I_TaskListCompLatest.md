## Access control

No DCL by design: Migration view on ECC: it must return every record of the object. Access is controlled by the user / RFC user of the load program and the extraction channel (S_TABU_NAM), not by CDS access control (decision XGEN-D01; CDS access control also needs a newer release than the 7.40 SP08 baseline).

## Example use case

Export the selected migration scope; validate keys and row counts before loading.

## Open verification items

none
