## Purpose

Read MaterialData as source candidates; approve the key-date population before posting.

## Keys

- `Product`

## Associations defined here

- none

## Access control

No DCL by design: Read-only migration extraction without DCL. Verify the extraction channel with permitted and restricted users. Table authorization does not protect every CDS consumer.

## Example use case

Export a small approved cohort, preserve internal keys, and compare with the mapped target population.

## Open verification items

`MMX-001` - see `BATCH_REPORT.md`.
