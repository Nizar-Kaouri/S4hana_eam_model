## Purpose

Read FreightOrderCompare as target comparison candidates.

## Keys

- `DocumentUUID`

## Associations defined here

- none

## Access control

No DCL by design: Read-only native migration extraction without DCL. Restrict the CDS extraction channel to authorized migration users; native table display authorization alone does not protect every CDS consumer. Verify business authorization and current-client isolation on SAP.

## Example use case

Export a small approved cohort, preserve internal keys, and compare with the mapped target population.

## Open verification items

`TMT-014` - see `BATCH_REPORT.md`.
