## Access control

No DCL by design: Administrative staging only. No DCL supplied: restrict table and CDS access to authorized migration users in an isolated client. These views do not inherit native EWM/TM/FSCM/EHS business authorizations. Never expose sensitive staging data through an unrestricted service.

## Example use case

Export a small approved cohort, preserve internal keys, and compare with the mapped target population.

none
