## Keys

- `ControllingArea`
- `COAccountingDocument`
- `COAccountingDocumentItem`

## Access control

No DCL by design: Read-only migration extraction without DCL. Verify the extraction channel with permitted and restricted users. Table authorization does not protect every CDS consumer.

Export a small approved cohort, preserve internal keys, and compare with the mapped target population.

`PSX-004` - see `BATCH_REPORT.md`.
