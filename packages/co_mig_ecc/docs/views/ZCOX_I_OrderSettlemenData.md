Read OrderSettlemenData as source candidates; approve the key-date population before posting.

## Keys

- `ObjectNumber`
- `DistributionRuleGroup`
- `DistributionRule`

- none

## Access control

No DCL by design: Read-only migration extraction without DCL. Verify the extraction channel with permitted and restricted users. Table authorization does not protect every CDS consumer.

## Example use case

Export a small approved cohort, preserve internal keys, and compare with the mapped target population.

## Open verification items

`COX-006` - see `BATCH_REPORT.md`.
